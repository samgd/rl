    "Monte Carlo methods only require experience - sample sequences of states, actions, and rewards from actual or simulated interaction with an environment. They do _not_ require complete knowledge of the environment dynamics. \n",

    "For simulated learning a model is required but it only needs to generate sample transitions and not the complete probability distribution of all possible transitions. There are a surprising number of places where it is easy to generate experience sampled according to the desired probability distribution but infeasible to obtain the distributions in explicit form.\n",
    "\n",
    "Monte Carlo methods solve the RL problem by averaging sample returns. Here we only consider Monte Carlo methods for episodic tasks. Only on completion of an episode are value estimates and policies changed. This means they can be used incrementally in an episode-by-episode nature but not in an online step-by-step way. \n",

Monte Carlo methods here _learn_ value functions from sample returns with the MDP. The value functions and corresponding policies still interact to obtain optimality via general policy iteration. \n",

    "- _visit_ to $s$: each occurrence of state $s$ in an episode\n",

    "Exercise 5.1: The value function jumps up for the last two rows as the policy is to stick at a value of 20 or 21 and the probability of the player winning when in either of these states is high. It drops off for the far right row (left in the book's figures) as the dealer has an ace (valued 11). An ace combined with a 10 means the player cannot and the probability of drawing a card with a value of 10 is relatively high (16/52). The frontmost values are higher when there is a usable ace as the player has less of a chance of going bust - if the player draws a high card to go bust in the lower diagrams they lose but in the upper diagrams the ace takes the value of 1 rather than 10 allowing the player to continue.\n",
