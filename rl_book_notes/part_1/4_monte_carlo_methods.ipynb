    "Monte Carlo methods only require experience - sample sequences of states, actions, and rewards from actual or simulated interaction with an environment. They do _not_ require complete knowledge of the environment dynamics. \n",

    "For simulated learning a model is required but it only needs to generate sample transitions and not the complete probability distribution of all possible transitions. There are a surprising number of places where it is easy to generate experience sampled according to the desired probability distribution but infeasible to obtain the distributions in explicit form.\n",
    "\n",
    "Monte Carlo methods solve the RL problem by averaging sample returns. Here we only consider Monte Carlo methods for episodic tasks. Only on completion of an episode are value estimates and policies changed. This means they can be used incrementally in an episode-by-episode nature but not in an online step-by-step way. \n",
